Important steps in Hibernate:
-----------------------------
1. Create an maven project 
2. Import dependencies needed into POM.xml file.(Such as hibernate, postgresql,javassist,etc)
3. Create the configuration file and mapping files under src/main/resources folder.
4. Create POJO class inside src/main/java/package/entities/Student.java
5. Create App.java inside src/main/java/package/App.java
6. Run the Hibernate application.

What are the methods which we have used till now?
--> save(), persist(), delete(), update(), saveOrUpdate(), get(), load()
--> The above methods allow us to deal with one object only / one record at a time.

But what if I want to process multiple records at a time?
--> 
1. HQL
2. Native SQL
3. Criteria API

In case of HQL we define our own specific queries according to our need.
NOTE: In HQL query we specify the class and its data members in the query.
for ex: SELECT rno,name,per,city FROM Student;
Here rno, name, & per are the data members name of Student class.

LEC - 28 2024/03/27
===================

Problem statement:
Sir in Version 6 of Hibernate app, you said that the save method is depricated and instead of save we should use the persist method
but the persist method returns void. So in case where I want to show user that its record is save with particular ID. So how we gonna show that to the user if we are using auto increment for primary key generation?

In that case we can use getIdentifier() method which can be created through session object
--> int id = (int) session.getIdentifier(sob);

What is a Transaction?
--> Transaction is a logical unit of work made up of one or more database operations like select, insert, delete, update.

Properties of Transation:
-------------------------
A - Atomicity
C - consistency
I - Isolation
D - Durability

Creating Hibernate applications using different versions

Version 4:
Creating an Hibernate application using this version requires updating the pom.xml file and creating an sessionFactory object in different manner:
      Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
    	configuration.configure();
    	
    	Properties prop = configuration.getProperties();
    	
    	StandardServiceRegistryBuilder builder = new StandardServiceRegistryBuilder();
    	
    	builder.applySettings(prop);
    	StandardServiceRegistry registry = builder.build();
    	
    	SessionFactory sessionFactory = configuration.buildSessionFactory(registry);
    	
      Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();

Version 5:
Creating an Hibernate application using this version requires 
1. updating the pom.xml file by adding 3 more dependencies:
    <dependency>
			<groupId>javax.xml.bind</groupId>
			<artifactId>jaxb-api</artifactId>
			<version>2.3.1</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.sun.xml.bind</groupId>
			<artifactId>jaxb-core</artifactId>
			<version>2.3.0.1</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.sun.xml.bind</groupId>
			<artifactId>jaxb-impl</artifactId>
			<version>2.3.1</version>
		</dependency>

2. Adding the following path to the VM arguments section:
  --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED


Version 6:
Creating an Hibernate application using this version requires 
1. updating the pom.xml through version 6 in normal way and here we don't need any additional dependencies.
2. In case of version 6 we require jdk version to be atleast 17 or more than it 
3. All the hibernate pakages is provided by Jakarta package. (Earlier it was provided by javax)
4. updating the Dialect class inside configuration file

Primary key Generation (To understand it better make sure u have the already created table and create property disabled within configuration file)
----------------------
Types to do AUTO INCREMENT Using Hibernate:
1. AUTO : In case of auto we make Hibenate to decide the underlying database used(it can be Postgresql or MySQL).
-- In case of using AUTO it will get replaced by either IDENTITY or SEQUENCE based on the underlying DB.
2. IDENTITY : It can be used for both MySQL and Postgresql
In case of Postgresql it internally calls the Serial method.
3. SEQUENCE : It is only used in case of Postgresql
4. TABLE: It supports all who doesn't have AUTO_INCREMENT or SERIAL keywords, for those databases hibernate says you can implement AUTO INCREMENT using 
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.TABLE) annotation

======
MySQL
======

CREATE TABLE Student(rno int primary key AUTO_INCREMENT, name varchar(20),per float);

INSERT INTO Student(name,per) VALUES('AAA',70);
INSERT INTO Student(name,per) VALUES('BBB',80);
INSERT INTO Student(name,per) VALUES('CCC',90);

mysql> desc Student;
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| rno   | int         | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| name  | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| per   | float       | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
+-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

-------------
Variant -1 : In-built sequence i.e. serial
-------------

//In postgresql the serial keyword contains the type int as well it specifies it a primary key by default.

CREATE TABLE Student(rno serial, name varchar(20),per float);

INSERT INTO Student(name,per) VALUES('AAA',70);
INSERT INTO Student(name,per) VALUES('BBB',80);
INSERT INTO Student(name,per) VALUES('CCC',90);

                                    Table "public.student"
 Column |         Type          | Collation | Nullable |               Default                
--------+-----------------------+-----------+----------+--------------------------------------
 rno    | integer               |           | not null | nextval('student_rno_seq'::regclass) 
 name   | character varying(20) |           |          | 
 per    | double precision      |           |          | 

(END)

NOTE: We can able to create our own sequence in Postgresql whereas in MySQL we cannot create our own sequence. 

-------------
Variant -2 : User defined sequence..
-------------

How can I able to create my own sequence?
==>
CREATE SEQUENCE wp_seq START 101;

CREATE TABLE Student(rno int PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT nextval('wp_seq'), name varchar(20),per float);

INSERT INTO Student(name,per) VALUES('AAA',70);
INSERT INTO Student(name,per) VALUES('BBB',80);
INSERT INTO Student(name,per) VALUES('CCC',90);

How to check which is the next val of the sequence?
==> select nextval('wp_seq');

Mapping details:
-- Student.hbm.xml
-- Annotations

Configuration Details:
1. Declarative approach
  -- Hibernate.cfg.xml
  -- Properties file
    A] By default property file : hibernate.properties
    B] User Defined Properties File : myconfig.properties

Properties file:
----------------
hibernate.properties is created under the resource folder
NO need of configure() method bcz by default when the configuration constructor is called it will search for hibernate.properties file

If we don't have the configuration file also we don't use annotation for POJO class:
  a. How to give mapping file details?
  --> it has given particular method : configuration.addResource("Student.hbm.xml");

What if we create the properties file with a different name as myconfig.properties?
--> In this case we need to create the Properties object and pass that object to configuration.setProperties() method.

2. Programmatic Approach
  -- Java code

QUESTIONS:
Earlier we used to give those details within configuration file. So, can't we pass those details within hibernate.properties file?
--> according to the explaination, if we don't have the configuration file, hibernate has given a provision to get the entity/POJO class through configuration.addAnnotated(Student.class) method.
=====================================================================================================================


LEC-21 12/03/2024
------------------

Mapping file is not mandatory instead we can make use of annotations.
The annotations which we are going to use is present inside 'javax.persistence' package.

--> Annotations to write Entity class
  -- @Entity
  -- @Table
  -- @Id
  -- @Column
--> How to register your entity class with Hibernate
  -- using tag <mapping class = "com.tca.entities.Student"/> inside hibernate.cfg.mml
  -- by calling addAnnotedClass() using Configuration object.

QUESTION:
Why Hibernate has given two ways for defining mapping file?

=====================================================================================================================

LEC-20 07/03/2024
------------------

To read/retrieve/fetch a record from database and to store into the object in Java then there are two methods.
-- get()  --> SELECT
-- load() --> SELECT

get():
  -->if ID is present then it returns object otherwise it return null
  EX:
    Student ob = (Student) session.get(Student.class,101);  --> ob = DATA
    Student ob = (Student) session.get(Student.class,103);  --> ob = null
  -->get() does early loading or eager loading

load():
  -->If ID is present then it returns object otherwise it gives "ObjectNotFoundException" exception.
  EX:
    Student ob = (Student) session.load(Student.class,101);  --> ob = DATA
    Student ob = (Student) session.load(Student.class,103);  --> ob = null

  --> load() does late loading or lazy loading.

NOTE: After calling get or load method hibernate internally calls the setters in order to set those values to data members and after calling the setter we can easily get that value.
What is the proof?
--> write println statement inside any setter and run this application.
Student ob = (Student) session.get(Student.class,101);

Story of load method:
This methods returns the object if found for particular record else it throws an exception and it follows lazy loading
The reason why we need to handle the exception	
Whenever we try to get non-id parameter value using getter at that moment the load method does the communication with the database until that it doesn't form any connection with the database...The reason why it does lazy loading.
Due to which application performance will also improve.

Story of get method:
This methods returns the object if found for particular record else it returns null
The reason why we don't need to handle the exception

=====================================================================================================================

LEC-19 06/03/2024
------------------

Use of class keyword: Whenever we make use of class keyword in the following way Student.class this indicates that all the data about the class is present within that following .class return type.
i.e., Class c = Student.class; //In this case all the info related to student class ie, constructors, methods, data members even the parent class info is present withing the object of class 'c'.

And this concept in java is known as reflection.

Assignment:
Can I access private data of a class using Reflection API?

=====================================================================================================================

LEC-18 05/03/2024
------------------

Persistance operations:
1. To insert or save an object into the database
-- save() --> INSERT 
-- persist() --> INSERT()
  Both methods works similar but the only difference is save() method returns the primary key value whereas persist() method doesn't return any value type.

2. To update record in database
-- update() - UPDATE
    Existing record will be updated based on <id> or primary key otherwise you will get an Exception

-- saveOrUpdate()
    --> Existing record : SELECT & INSERT SQL is fired
    --> Non-Existing record : SELECT & INSERT SQL is fired &
    --> No Exception is generated

3.To delete record from database
-- delete() 
    --> Existing record : SELECT & DELETE SQL is fired
    --> Non-Existing record : SELECT SQL is fired &
    --> No Exception is generated
    --> NOTE: 
            Case 1: When we are using Wrapper types(Integer) inside POJO class
                  --> In case of delete if don't specify the id attribute then its not going to generate the SELECT query as well as it doesn't throw any exception bcs the 'id' attribute value is null.

            Case 2: When we are using primitive types(int) inside POJO class
                  --> In case of delete if don't specify the id attribute then its going to generate the SELECT query as well as it doesn't throw any exception bcz the 'id' attribute value is 0(i.e., default value of int).

4. To read/retrieve a record from database
-- get()  --> SELECT
-- load() --> SELECT

In this lecture we are going to cover update record part.

QUESTIONS:
What are the fields that we can pass inside hbm2ddl field?
What happens when we are using create property and in APP.java we use the update() method?
