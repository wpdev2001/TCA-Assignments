Important steps in Hibernate:
-----------------------------
1. Create an maven project 
2. Import dependencies needed into POM.xml file.(Such as hibernate, postgresql,javassist,etc)
3. Create the configuration file and mapping files under src/main/resources folder.
4. Create POJO class inside src/main/java/package/entities/Student.java
5. Create App.java inside src/main/java/package/App.java
6. Run the Hibernate application.

Use of class keyword: Whenever we make use of class keyword in the following way Student.class this indicates that all the data about the class is present within that following .class return type.
i.e., Class c = Student.class; //In this case all the info related to student class ie, constructors, methods, data members even the parent class info is present withing the object of class 'c'.

And this concept in java is known as reflection.

Persistance operations:
1. To insert or save an object into the database
-- save() --> INSERT 
-- persist() --> INSERT()
  Both methods works similar but the only difference is save() method returns the primary key value whereas persist() method doesn't return any value type.

2. To update record in database
-- update() - UPDATE
    Existing record will be updated based on <id> or primary key otherwise you will get an Exception

-- saveOrUpdate()
    --> Existing record : SELECT & INSERT SQL is fired
    --> Non-Existing record : SELECT & INSERT SQL is fired &
    --> No Exception is generated

3.To delete record from database
-- delete() 
    --> Existing record : SELECT & DELETE SQL is fired
    --> Non-Existing record : SELECT SQL is fired &
    --> No Exception is generated
    --> NOTE: 
            Case 1: When we are using Wrapper types(Integer) inside POJO class
                  --> In case of delete if don't specify the id attribute then its not going to generate the SELECT query as well as it doesn't throw any exception bcs the 'id' attribute value is null.

            Case 2: When we are using primitive types(int) inside POJO class
                  --> In case of delete if don't specify the id attribute then its going to generate the SELECT query as well as it doesn't throw any exception bcz the 'id' attribute value is 0(i.e., default value of int).

4. To read/retrieve a record from database
-- get()  --> SELECT
-- load() --> SELECT

In this lecture we are going to cover update record part.

QUESTIONS:
What are the fields that we can pass inside hbm2ddl field?
What happens when we are using create property and in APP.java we use the update() method?
